## 🔧 Troubleshooting

3. **Try different voices** - Each ElevenLabs voice has a unique style
4. **Check your account** - Make sure you have API credits available

### Voice Dropdown is Empty?
1. **Reload the page** - Sometimes voices need to load
2. **Check browser permissions** - Ensure speech synthesis is enabled
3. **Restart browser** - This can help load system voices

### Voice Doesn't Change?
1. **Wait for restart** - The article restarts automatically with the new voice
2. **Stop and start again** - Press `Alt + X` then `Alt + R`
3. **Check the dropdown** - Make sure your selection was saved

## 🎤 Technical Details

### How It Works
The extension uses the **ElevenLabs API** to generate ultra-realistic speech:
1. **Text is sent** to ElevenLabs servers
2. **AI generates audio** using neural networks
3. **Audio is streamed back** to your browser
4. **Playback begins** immediately

For long articles, the text is automatically split into chunks for seamless playback.

### Voice Preferences
Your voice selection is saved in **localStorage**, so it persists:
- ✅ Across page reloads
- ✅ Across different websites
- ✅ Until you change it

### Voice Priority
When "Auto" is selected, the extension uses:
1. Your saved ElevenLabs voice preference
2. The first available voice in your account
3. Fallback to browser voices if ElevenLabs is unavailable

### API Usage
- Each character read uses API credits
- Long articles are split into ~2500 character chunks
- Audio is cached during the reading session
- Pausing/resuming doesn't use extra credits
