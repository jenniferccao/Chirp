# 🎤 Sticky Whispers - Demo Script for SheHacks+

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Sticky Whispers is an AI-powered Chrome extension that lets you leave voice notes on any webpage—and they stick! Using ElevenLabs' cutting-edge AI, we've added automatic transcription, text-to-speech, and audio enhancement. It's like sticky notes, but with your voice, enhanced by AI, and searchable across your entire browsing history."

## 🎬 Full Demo Script (3-5 minutes)

### Opening Hook (15 seconds)
"Have you ever wished you could leave a voice note on a website and have it be there next time you visit? What if that note was automatically transcribed, searchable, and enhanced with AI? That's Sticky Whispers."

### Problem Statement (20 seconds)
"We browse hundreds of websites daily—research papers, shopping sites, tutorials. We take notes, but they're scattered across apps, hard to organize, and disconnected from where we found the information. Plus, typing is slow and not accessible to everyone."

### Solution Introduction (30 seconds)
"Sticky Whispers solves this by letting you place voice notes directly on webpages. But we didn't stop there—we integrated ElevenLabs AI to make these whispers smart. Every recording is automatically transcribed, enhanced for clarity, and fully searchable. You can even create whispers from text using premium AI voices."

### Live Demo Part 1: Voice Recording (45 seconds)

**[Open a Wikipedia article about AI]**

"Let me show you. I'm researching AI for a project. Let me leave a voice note."

**[Click extension icon]**

"I'll click 'Start Recording'..."

**[Record]**: "Remember to cite this section about neural networks in my paper. The transformer architecture is key."

**[Stop and place]**

"Now I click anywhere on the page to place it. See the sparkles? And notice—it's already been transcribed!"

**[Hover over bubble]**

"When I hover, I can see what I said without playing it."

### Live Demo Part 2: Text-to-Speech (30 seconds)

**[Switch to Text tab]**

"But what if you want to create a note from text? Maybe you're in a quiet library or have accessibility needs."

**[Type]**: "Check pricing before buying. Compare with Amazon."

**[Select voice and generate]**

"I'll choose Antoni's voice... and generate. ElevenLabs creates natural-sounding speech in seconds."

**[Place and play]**

"Sounds like a real person, right?"

### Live Demo Part 3: Search (30 seconds)

**[Open extension, go to Search tab]**

"Now here's where it gets powerful. I've been leaving whispers all week. Let me search for 'neural networks'..."

**[Type in search]**

"Instantly, it finds every whisper where I mentioned neural networks, across all websites. Click any result to jump right to that page."

### Key Features Highlight (30 seconds)

**[Show features list]**

You're walking through a museum, you say 'Hey Meta, leave a whisper,' and it places a voice note on the museum's website. Later, you search your whispers and relive your experience. That's the future we're building."

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### For Judges

1. **AI Integration**: "We're using ElevenLabs' most advanced APIs—text-to-speech, audio isolation, and voice management."

2. **Accessibility**: "This is huge for accessibility. Voice input is faster than typing and helps those with motor difficulties."

3. **Privacy**: "All data is stored locally in the browser. Your API key never leaves your device."

4. **Scalability**: "The architecture supports future features like voice cloning, multi-language, and collaborative whispers."

5. **Market Fit**: "Students, researchers, shoppers, anyone who browses the web can use this. That's billions of potential users."

### For Technical Questions

**Q: Why ElevenLabs?**
A: "ElevenLabs has the most natural-sounding text-to-speech on the market. Their audio isolation API is perfect for cleaning up voice recordings. Plus, they offer 10,000 free characters per month."

**Q: How does transcription work?**
A: "We use the browser's built-in Web Speech API for real-time transcription. It's free, fast, and works offline. For premium features, we could integrate ElevenLabs' speech-to-text in the future."

**Q: What about storage limits?**
A: "We use Chrome's local storage, which has a 10MB limit per domain. For 30-second recordings at standard quality, that's about 50-100 whispers per site. We're planning cloud sync for unlimited storage."

**Q: Can you share whispers?**
A: "Not yet, but it's on our roadmap. We're planning collaborative workspaces where teams can share whispers on the same URLs."

**Q: How does it work with Meta Glasses?**
A: "Currently it's a concept, but Meta Glasses have voice commands and AR capabilities. We'd integrate voice-activated whisper creation and AR visualization of whispers in physical space."

### For Business Questions

**Q: How would you monetize?**
A: "Freemium model. Free tier with 10,000 characters/month (via ElevenLabs free tier). Premium: $9.99/month for unlimited characters, cloud sync, voice cloning, and team features."

**Q: What's your target market?**
A: "Initially: students and researchers. They spend hours browsing educational content and need better note-taking. Then expand to professionals, shoppers, and accessibility users."

**Q: What's your competitive advantage?**
A: "We're the only voice note extension with AI transcription, enhancement, and search. Competitors like Kami and Hypothesis only do text annotations. We're voice-first and AI-powered."
